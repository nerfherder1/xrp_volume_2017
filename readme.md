# XRP 2017 BULL RUN ESTIMATION

Basic calculation (without live trades during that time) using 5 min interval.  
It pull the data from the day before bull run to the completed bar of the highest peak.  
Formula : high*volume = dollar amount  -> Sums the dollar amount for entire period.


    Total amount of USDT to hit 3.28 : $1,879,792,913.25
   
    $1.87 BILLION DOLLARS

If we really wanted to be simplistic and innacurate we could do the following:  
I do not claim the below to be accurate but just for entertainment purposes. 

    589 / 3.28 = 179.57  (589.00 / ATH)
    179.57 * 1,879,792,913.25 = 337,554,413,432.30
    $337.50 BILLION DOLLARS TO REACH 589.00

## Disclaimer
I do not have live trades from that time.  I am merely taking what is available and using a "high estimation" to determine what it may take on one exchange to reach the ATH again.  Someone else can figure out what it may take to hit 589.00 for or against the EOY 2018 arguement people love to discuss.
